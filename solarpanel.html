         <p>Solar panels can save an <strong>average of up to $3,000</strong> after 20 years!</p>
       <p>Solar Panels only last up to <strong>25-30 years</strong> before they need to be replaced.</p>
            <h3><strong>Steps in which a photovoltaic solar cell will generate electricity:</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>“Solar cells absorb incoming energy in the form of sunlight”</li>
                    <li>Electrons begin to flow, generating an electrical current</li>
                    <li>“Wiring captures the electrical current and combines it with power from other solar cells” </li>
                </ul>
        <h3><strong>Benifits:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A benefit of using a household solar panel is the renewable energy available. </li>
            <li>Cheaper than fossil fuels and will not cause pollution</li>
            <li>You will save money on maintenance repairs, because solar panels have no moving parts that can quit working.</li>
            <li>The cost for solar panels and solar panel batteries have decreased.</li>
             <li>Not loud or noisy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>California has the most populated usage with solar panels.</p>
        <p>Solar energy is the <strong>fastest energy source</strong> that can be collected.</p>
        <p>It takes less than 10 minutes for light from the sun to travel to earth!</p>
        <p>Solar panels are also super reliable.</p>
        <p>Solar panels can even power calculators! By having a solar panel at the top which it can collect the energy from the sun.</p>
        <p>They can also <strong>reduce your electricity bills!</strong></p>
        <p>Solar panels have been in use for over 2,700 years! Used in 700 BC by using glass lenses to magnify the sun’s rays which can produce a fire. </p>
