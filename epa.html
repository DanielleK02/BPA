            <h3><strong>EPA- Environmental Protection Agency:</strong></h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Their mission is to protect the health of the environment and people.</li>
                    <li>They are responsible for creating law that influences the health for the citizens and environment.</li>
                </ul>
                    
        <p>One program they have is <strong>“The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System”</strong> which they maintain the amount of discharges of pollutants into United States oceans, seas, etc.</p>
            <h3><strong>Possible challenges with EPA:</strong></h3>
                <li>Meeting health-based standards for common air pollutants
                    <img id="stop" src="stop.jpg" alt="stopP" width="200" height="200">
                    <ul>
                        <li>New studies have shown that some pollutants can harm public health and welfare even at very low levels, in recent years the EPA revised their standards for 5 of the 6 common pollutants making it harder to meet their standards.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Limiting climate change
                    <ul>
                        <li>The EPA determined in 2009 that emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases that build up in the atmosphere endanger the health and welfare of current and future generations by causing climate change and ocean acidification.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Reducing risks from toxic air pollutants
                    <ul>
                        <li>The EPA takes the following steps to reduce risks from toxic air pollutants: reducing toxic emissions from industrial sources; reducing emissions from vehicles and engines through new stringent emission standards and cleaner burning gasoline; and addressing indoor air pollution though voluntary programs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Protecting the stratospheric ozone layer against degradation
                    <ul>
                        <li>To prevent the ozone layer from degrading, the EPA implements the following regulatory programs: Ensure that refrigerants and halon fire extinguishing agents are recycled properly, ensure that alternatives to ozone-depleting substances are evaluated for their impacts on human health and the environment, ban the release of ozone-depleting refrigerants during the service, maintenance, and disposal of air conditioners and other refrigeration equipment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
