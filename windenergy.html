        <p><strong>Wind energy</strong> is the process of conducting electricity using wind from the earth’s atmosphere.</p>
    
            <p><strong>There are three different types of wind energy:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Utility-scale wind:</strong> ranges from 100 kilowatts to several megawatts, which power gets distributed to the power grid, which is then distributed to the user.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distributed wind:</strong> which are small wind turbines that are below 100 kilowatts which are used to directly a home or small business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Offshore wind: </strong>turbines that are constructed in large bodies of water. These turbines are larger than on land turbines.</li>
                </ul>
        <p>The blades on a wind turbine gather the wind’s kinetic energy and rotate, which it then gets turned into mechanical energy</p>
        <p>The standard size of a wind turbine is at least 80 meters which is 262 feet tall. </p>
        <p><strong>Turbine Components:</strong></p>
         <ul>
                <li>Rotor</li>
                <li>Drive train</li>
                <li>Tower</li>
            </ul>
        <p>A wind turbine does not start generating electricity unless the wind is blowing at 6-9 mph. Which, it will turn off is the winds are too strong which is around a wind speed of 55 mph. </p>

        <p>Wind turbine blades are similar to aircraft propeller blades!</p>
        <p>A <strong>wind farm</strong> is really common which are a large group of wind turbines to generate energy from the wind.</p>
        <p>Wind energy is a <strong>renewable resource</strong> which is good for the economy. </p>
